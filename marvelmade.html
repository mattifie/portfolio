                    <h4>summary</h4>
                    <p>Marvelmade is a project I was assigned during my Bloc apprenticeship. The project required us to create a fundraising web app in which two primary user groups, fundraisers and donors, could collaborate to crowdfund charities and fundraisers for specific causes.</p>

                    <p>I opted to create a fundraising platform that focused on education-based causes, and allowed for both monetary and time donations. Through creating and conducting user surveys, personas, and flows, I was able to then wireframe, design, and develop the identity and front-end framework for the Marvelmade web app. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>problem</h4>
                    <p>While a number of fundraising platforms already exist, Bloc posed us the challenge of creating an improved, original version of what had already been done.</p>

                    <h4>user research</h4>
                    <p>The first step in executing a solution was to conduct user research. To launch this research phase, I created user surveys for both potential donors and fundraisers. I analyzed survey results to determine what features these potential users thought necessary. I established that prospective users were not only interested in donating money, but also time, especially in the realm of something as hands-on as education. From there, I was able to illustrate a series of representative personas, as well as user flow diagrams to establish the donor and campaign-creator processes.</p>

                    <p>With plenty of user research in tow, I created a series of low fidelity wireframes, providing a framework for the Marvelmade app. This step proved invaluable, as Marvelmade’s user flows and user stories deviated slightly from the typical fundraising web app. With the option to donate time, donation options as well as campaign creation took on additional capabilities. These options needed to be integrated smoothly, without added clunk or confusion for the user.</p>

                    <p>After establishing the app’s flows, framework, and user personas, it was time to shift into giving Marvelmade some color.</p>
                    <p>As an education-focused app with aims to bring students to their impending superstar status, I instantly thought of superheroes. The name “Marvelmade” seems logical now, doesn’t it? Superheroes connote power, goodness, success, and of course, boldness.</p>
                    <p>Aligning with the comic-style graphics that birthed the first superheroes, I worked with playful, retro fonts and a lively color palette. I experimented with traditional color theory, selecting an orange and blue palette that conveyed vibrance and evoked nostalgic sentiments a la primary school art class.</p>

                    <p>The Marvelmade logo needed to follow this throwback, heroic suit. I sketched a few concepts on paper and subsequently in Illustrator, and workshopped them to determine which logo was Marvelmade-worthy.</p>
                    <p>Although the superhero bent made sense, the effectiveness of the logo was lost in unnecessary detail. The concept of a book then entered, and it became a matter of fusing the book with the brand. Certain book sketches were obscured to the point of being unidentifiable. The logo still had to read “book,” but it also had to exude the bright energy of the app’s overarching goals and core users. With a bit of reworking, I came to create the following:</p>
