                    <h4>summary</h4>
                    <p>The Wicked Hop has been a Milwaukee staple since it opened in 2004. The restaurant's Bloody Mary has a reputation of its own, and the lofty interior has been known to host a rousing dance party. While The Wicked Hop has been ahead of the curve in a number of ways, it wasn't quite current with social media marketing. I partnered with a coworker to collaboratively bring the spot up to speed.</p>

                    <h4>branding & identity</h4>
                    <p>The Wicked Hop has always been difficult to categorize. 
                    The restaurant's atmosphere is most certainly original, as it is a product of uninhibited employee charisma, a contemporary loft space's airy atmosphere, and the straightforward presentation of undeniably solid pub grub. The Hop's ambiance evolved organically, rather than being proposed as having a certain environment, and patrons favor the spot for its honest persona.</p>
                    <p>Our challenge was to produce social media content that reflected the diverse assets of the restaurant, particularly the hodge podge combination of its upscale and unrestrained elements.</p>

                    <h4>content tone & voice</h4>
                    <p>Content had to be equally as diverse, but required a common thread for cohesion. We decided that a balance of restaurant-specific content, such as food photographs and special announcements, smart humor, and a smattering of pop culture would accurately evoke in social media followers what the restaurant evoked in customers: unfettered enjoyment.</p>

                    <h4>progress & results</h4>
                    <p>With frequent content posts, we were able to augment the follower base significantly on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter platforms. We implemented an Instagram account and grew the following to more than 700 in the first year. We increased Facebook followers by more than 1,500 in the first six months, and Twitter followers by more than 300.</p>
                    <p class="final">Additionally, we were able to provide attentive, reliable customer service via both Facebook and Twitter. Several customer issues and complaints were resolved through social media conversation.</p>
